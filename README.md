# user-interface-application-meteorologichno
This project was created by me and my friend (Owen Octavious)
Meteorologichno is a mobile application that provides information about the latest weather. On the Meteorologichno app, potential users can view weather forecasts, air quality, information regarding earthquakes, climate, maritime weather, flight weather, and weather forest-land fires. The emergence of this idea was caused by the large number of people who needed information about the weather to do outdoor activities. Many people often find it difficult to find information about the latest weather and information about earthquakes. Usually, they get this information through the news on television. In addition, the community does not have enough time due to the large number of activities carried out. Therefore, the Meteorologichno application is the right solution to overcome the problem.

Then, we create an engaging mobile application.
Before creating the user interface design of the Meteorologichno application, we create:
• Scenario: Stories, Conceptual Scenario, Concrete Scenario, Use Cases 
• Persona
• User Journey
• Wireframe 1: Wireframe
• Wireframe 2 and Navigation Map: Wireframe, Navigation Map
